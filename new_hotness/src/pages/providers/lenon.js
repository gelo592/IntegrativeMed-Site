          Rachel's passion for preventative medicine began while working as an RN
          in the Cardiac ICU. It was there she saw firsthand the value of prevention
          and healthy lifestyle to avoid chronic disease. Rachel worked as a nurse
          practitioner in a family medicine clinic, gaining valuable experience in
          treating a wide range of both acute and chronic illnesses.

          Rachel joined the team at the Integrative Medicine Clinic (IMC) in June
          of 2014. Her goal is to provide a holistic approach to healthcare that
          focuses on prevention and looking for the root causes of a patient's
          health concerns, rather than just treating the symptoms. Lifestyle
          modifications such as stress management, regular exercise, nutrient
          dense diet, and quality sleep are foundational aspects of the Integrative
          Medicine approach. She provides to patients of all ages who prefer an
          integrative approach to medicine.
