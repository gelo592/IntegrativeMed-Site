Recent research indicates that activity is a key to good health. Importantly, this movement does not need to be highlevel aerobic activity like running or jogging. Walking, dancing, gardening, chores around the house, these are all terrific examples of healthy activity. Pick activities that interest you and get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. The research tells us that it is just as effective to split up these activities throughout the day. In fact, staying active all day is best because sitting for prolonged periods, all by itself, has been shown to reduce health and longevity. If you have a sedentary job, or enjoy watching TV, get up every 60 minutes or so and move around for a few minutes to reduce the negative effects of being sedentary."),o.a.createElement(p.a,{className:a.para},"Maintaining a Healthy Body Weight throughout adulthood impacts our health positively by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, reducing the risk of cancer, and protecting our joints. Medical research has shown that we do not need to be slim - we simply need not to become obese to enjoy these health benefits. Body mass index (BMI) is the measure doctors use to assess for healthy body weight. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are tools available online to simplify this calculation. A normal BMI is less than 25, 25-30 is considered overweight, and greater than 30 is considered obese. What the interventions require is that you have a BMI of less than 30, less than obese. For example, if you are 5’4” tall in order to have a BMI of less than 30 you need to weigh under 170 pounds and if you are 5’9” tall a weight of under 200 pounds will get you there - for most that is not too strict. It is important to note that weight loss of just 10 pounds can have measurable health benefits, particularly on blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Aim for a BMI of less than 30 but recognize that even modest improvements in weight are quite helpful!"),o.a.createElement(p.a,{className:a.para},"While high-tech medicine has many incredible health benefits, current research tells us that low-tech lifestyle changes and nutritional medicine has the potential for even greater health benefits.
