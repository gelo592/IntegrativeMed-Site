They\n      compared randomly selected individuals who were either on CoQ10, 100mg three times\n      daily, or placebo. They were monitored for 24 months. The study's primary endpoint was\n      major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), which included unplanned hospital\n      admission because of worsening heart failure symptoms, cardiovascular death,\n      mechanical circulatory support, and urgent cardiac transplantation. The researchers\n      reported that CoQ10 reduced the risk of MACE by approximately 50%.\n      Importantly, all cause mortality was also reduced by 50% in the CoQ10 group, 18 deaths\n      in the treated-group vs. 36 deaths in the placebo-group.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      The studies author Prof. Mortensen wrote:\n      \"CoQ10 is the first medication to improve survival in chronic heart failure since ACE\n      inhibitors and beta blockers more than a decade ago and should be added to standard\n      heart failure therapy.”\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      “Other heart failure medications block rather than enhance cellular processes and may\n      have side effects. Supplementation with CoQ10, which is a natural and safe substance,\n      corrects a deficiency in the body and blocks the vicious metabolic cycle in chronic heart\n      failure called the energy starved heart.\"\n      CoQ10 is found in almost every cell in the body and is vital in the conversion of food into\n      cellular energy, acting as a cofactor along the electron transport chain deep in the\n      mitochondria. CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant, protecting the cell and mitochondria\n      from oxidative damage.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      CoQ10 is manufactured in the body, though less as we age, and can be found in certain\n      foods, especially organ meat, fish and poultry. Dietary sources are insufficient to have a\n      significant impact on heart failure. Additionally, important medications, including statins\n      and beta-blockers, significantly deplete the body of CoQ10.\n      Though it is considered very safe there are few important interactions or side effects for\n      CoQ10. There have been reports of it reducing the benefits of wafarin and clopidigrel.

This growing epidemic has the potential to\n      derail our health care system and it is largely preventable!\n      Sugar is added to many of the foods we eat daily. Examples\n      include applesauce, bread, cereal, chips, ketchup, soft drinks and\n      yogurt, to name a few. The average American eats 130 pounds of\n      sugar annually, really 130 pounds! Most of the sugar is added\n      gratuitously to food with no nutritional benefit. With all of that\n      sugar it is no wonder there is an epidemic of diabetes in this\n      country.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Sugar sweetened beverages are some of the worst offenders. A\n      single 12-ounce can of can of cola contains 42 grams of sugar, 160\n      calories. A whopping 10 teaspoons of sugar per can! It does not\n      stop there, in a typical breakfast cereal or pop tart there is 20 – 40\n      grams of sugar, or 5 to 10 teaspoons.

Reducing it would prevent\n      many of the future cases of diabetes. This was clearly\n      demonstrated by Dr. Lustig, a pediatric diabetes specialist, who\n      restored normal blood sugar control in children with pre-diabetes\n      by eliminating all foods with added sugars in their diets. The\n      children ate the same amount calories but no food with added\n      sugar. Their pre-diabetes reversed completely in 10 days! Sadly,\n      children frequently develop type II diabetes, a disease previously\n      thought to occur only in adults.

Carbohydrates in the form of breads, bagels,\n      cereals, crackers, pasta, sweet fruits, and fruit juices are\n      problematic for diabetics, raising blood sugar substantially.

It senselessly raises blood sugar and does not address the\n      root of the diabetic problem – the inability to tolerate sugar and\n      carbohydrates in the diet.

The first is walking 10 minutes after\n      eating. Walking stimulates the rapid uptake and storage of glucose\n      in muscle. This effect is so powerful that it decreases the rise in\n      blood sugar after eating up to 50%. That is an amazing benefit for\n      10 minutes of walking!\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      The second practice is using apple cider vinegar to inhibit glucose\n      absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. To do this mix 1\n      tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in 4 ounces of water, and\n      possibly a small amount of honey for taste, then drink it with your\n      meal.

The\n      PPI’s can help control these symptoms and, importantly, they can also heal a raw, red, and\n      even ulcerated upper GI tract. However, like most powerful medications, they can have\n      serious side effects, including limiting absorption of important vitamins and minerals.\n      They also increase the risk of heart attacks, osteoporosis, the premature thinning of the\n      bones, and increase the risk of certain infections.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      There are 21 million Americans on PPI’s daily though they were never intended for longterm\n      use. In fact, current recommendations hold that they are best used only 4 – 8 weeks.\n      A key factor that keeps people on these medications long-term, besides the doctor’s\n      prescription, is that when stopping PPI’s one may actually produce more stomach acid\n      then before the medication was ever started – that is, they can worsen the very problem\n      they were supposed to treat.\n    </Typography>\n     <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Whether one may use over the counter versions of these medications, as needed, or daily,\n      as prescribed your doctor, it is possible for most people to safely wean from these\n      medications. We will discuss the strategy to do so below. Before we do I want to state\n      that there are certain medical conditions that require these medications long-term so\n      please check with your doctor before making any changes in your medications.\n      The most common reversible causes of heartburn are eating too much, eating too late,\n      eating processed, packaged, and fast foods, drinking alcohol, and eating foods that we\n      may have sensitivities too. The following are suggestions to limit heartburn symptoms\n      naturally.\n    </Typography>\n      <ul>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Eat your evening meal as early as possible, preferably at least 3 hours before bed.\n        Going to bed soon after eating increases the potential for food to reflux from the\n        stomach into the esophagus causing heartburn.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Many Americans eat their largest meal in the evening; other cultures eat the\n        largest meal at noon. Eating larger meals early in the day can be very helpful.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Limit packaged and processed foods because they contain unhealthy fats and\n        carbohydrates, which are a frequent cause of reflux.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Reduce or eliminate alcohol. If you choose to have alcohol limit it to 1 or 2\n        servings with your meal and no alcohol 3 hours before bed. Alcohol opens the\n        valve between the stomach and the esophagus, which encourages reflux.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Wheat, dairy, corn, and sugar are common food sensitivities and a common\n        trigger of reflux. Eliminating these for 3 or 4 weeks is a great test to determine if\n        these foods are problematic for you. If your symptoms improve then one or more\n        of the bunch is likely to be the culprit. Add the foods back to your diet\n        individually to see which one may be the offender.</Typography></li>\n      </ul>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Once your symptoms improve, possibly from implementing one or more of the ideas\n      above, and you have consulted with your physician, it may be time to gradually wean the\n      omeprazole, lansoprazole or other PPI. The following is the method I have used\n      successfully in many patients. Remember that these PPI’s actually create a short-term\n      increase in acid production when they are being discontinued so wean them slowly.\n    </Typography>\n      <ul>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Start by taking the medication every other day. On the days off the PPI use\n        Pepcid/famotidine, 20mg, this is an acid reducer too, but less powerful.

The achievements of modern medicine are truly incredible.\n      What is MORE INCREDIBLE, in my opinion, is that four low-tech lifestyle\n      interventions have been proven to provide even greater health benefits than modern\n      medications and surgeries!\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      What are these AMAZING, health promoting, lifestyle interventions?\n    </Typography>\n      <ol>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Stop Smoking</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Eat Vegetables and Fruit Every Day</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Move Every Day</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Maintain a Healthy Weight</Typography></li>\n      </ol>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      How AMAZING are these interventions? VERY! According to recent research, if you\n      follow these four lifestyle recommendations they can reduce your risk of the following\n      illnesses by ASTONISHING amounts:\n    </Typography>\n      <ul>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Reduce Diabetes by 93%</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Reduce Heart Attacks by 81%</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Reduce Strokes by 50%</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Reduce Cancer by 36%</Typography></li>\n      </ul>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable disease in the world. Not only does\n      smoking affect the smoker, second hand smoke impacts the health of family, friends, and\n      coworkers. Quitting smoking is not easy, but it is worth it! Quitting starts with the simple\n      act of thinking why one may want to quit; e.g., personal health reasons, financial\n      concerns, and, for many, a desire to be healthier to more fully participate in the lives of\n      loved ones. Once a meaningful reason is decided upon, there are resources that can help a\n      person succeed. These include the following:\n    </Typography>\n      <ul>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Talk with your healthcare provider about options to support smoking cessation.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> 1 800 Quit Now, 1 800 784 8669</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Nicotine replacement patches and gum</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Medications</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Acupuncture</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Commit by informing friends and family of your intentions.</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Plan the quit date!</Typography></li>\n        <li><Typography className={classes.para}> Remember, not everyone is successful the first attempt at smoking cessation - the key is to have determination and persistence!</Typography></li>\n      </ul>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Eating Vegetables and Fruits is incredibly powerful in lowering the risk of several\n      chronic diseases. This does not mean you need to become a vegetarian, just add colorful\n      vegetables and fruit to your food choices each day. Vegetables and fruits are high in four\n      vital nutrients: fiber, magnesium, potassium, and importantly, polyphenols. Fiber,\n      magnesium, and potassium work wonders lowering cholesterol, blood pressure, and the\n      risk of colon cancer while also improving the function of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e.,\n      reducing constipation.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      The natural pigments that add beautiful colors to food and provide many health benefits\n      are known as polyphenols. The red colored lycopene, found in tomatoes and\n      watermelons, is known to decrease heart disease and cancer. Another healthful\n      polyphenol is the yellow-green pigment lutein; lutein is found in green leafy vegetables\n      and is known to reduce the risk of macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness in\n      adults. Anthocyanidin, the blue pigment found in berries, has been shown to decrease\n      blood pressure, lower inflammation, and improve brain health. Eating more servings of\n      colorful vegetables and fruits daily, preferably a serving or two with each meal, will help\n      reduce the risk of many chronic and debilitating diseases.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Moving Every Day has a big impact on health and longevity. Recent research indicates\n      that activity is a key to good health. Importantly, this movement does not need to be highlevel\n      aerobic activity like running or jogging. Walking, dancing, gardening, chores\n      around the house, these are all terrific examples of healthy activity. Pick activities that\n      interest you and get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. The research tells us that it is\n      just as effective to split up these activities throughout the day. In fact, staying active all\n      day is best because sitting for prolonged periods, all by itself, has been shown to reduce\n      health and longevity. If you have a sedentary job, or enjoy watching TV, get up every 60\n      minutes or so and move around for a few minutes to reduce the negative effects of being\n      sedentary.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      Maintaining a Healthy Body Weight throughout adulthood impacts our health\n      positively by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, reducing the risk of cancer, and\n      protecting our joints. Medical research has shown that we do not need to be slim - we\n      simply need not to become obese to enjoy these health benefits. Body mass index (BMI)\n      is the measure doctors use to assess for healthy body weight. BMI is calculated by\n      dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are tools available online\n      to simplify this calculation. A normal BMI is less than 25, 25-30 is considered\n      overweight, and greater than 30 is considered obese. What the interventions require is\n      that you have a BMI of less than 30, less than obese. For example, if you are 5’4” tall in\n      order to have a BMI of less than 30 you need to weigh under 170 pounds and if you are\n      5’9” tall a weight of under 200 pounds will get you there - for most that is not too strict.\n      It is important to note that weight loss of just 10 pounds can have measurable health\n      benefits, particularly on blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Aim for a\n      BMI of less than 30 but recognize that even modest improvements in weight are quite\n      helpful!\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography className={classes.para}> \n      While high-tech medicine has many incredible health benefits, current research tells us\n      that low-tech lifestyle changes and nutritional medicine has the potential for even greater\n      health benefits. Let’s bring these wonderful health benefits to our lives by quitting\n      smoking, eating vegetables, moving every day, and maintaining a healthy body weight.\n      In doing so, we will add years to our lives and life to our years!\n    </Typography>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(PreventionArticle)\n\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Layout from '../../components/layout'\nimport SEO from '../../components/seo'\nimport CoQ10Article from '../../components/articles/coq10';\nimport SugarArticle from '../../components/articles/sugarDiabetes';\nimport EatingArticle from '../../components/articles/eatWell';\nimport GIArticle from '../../components/articles/GIHealth';\nimport PreventionArticle from '../../components/articles/prevention';\n// import DietaryArticle from '../../components/articles/dietaryGuidelines';\nimport { Paper, Typography, Grid } from '@material-ui/core';\nimport SubLayout from '../../components/sublayout';\nimport { colors } from '../../constants/constants';\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\nimport withRoot from '../../components/withRoot';\n\nconst styles = theme => ({\n  para: {\n    lineHeight: 2.2,\n    fontSize: 17,\n    paddingBottom: 20,\n    color: colors.text,\n  },\n  link: {\n    color: colors.imc_blue.light,\n  },\n  sectionHeaderCenter: {\n    marginBottom: theme.spacing.unit * 3,\n    textAlign: 'center',\n    color: colors.imc_blue.light,\n  },\n  sectionHeader: {\n    color: colors.imc_blue.light,\n  },\n  paper: {\n    padding: '30px 20px',\n    marginBottom: theme.spacing.unit * 4,\n  },\n  author: {\n    // textTransform: 'uppercase',\n    // color: colors.text,\n    fontSize: 16,\n  },\n  date: {\n    marginBottom: theme.spacing.unit * 3,\n    textTransform: 'uppercase',\n    color: colors.text,\n    fontSize: 12,\n  }\n});\n\nclass ArticlesPage extends React.Component {\n  // state = {\n  //   currentKey: 'coq10'\n  // };\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    console.log(props.location);\n    let currentKey = 'coq10';\n    if (props && props.location && props.location.state && props.location.state.currentKey !== null) {\n      console.log(\"hi\");\n      currentKey = props.location.state.currentKey;\n    } else if (props && props.location && props.location.search !== null) {\n      currentKey = props.location.search.slice(1);\n    }\n    this.state = {\n      currentKey,\n    }\n  }\n\n  _switchArticle = (newKey) => {\n    this.setState({ currentKey: newKey });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // console.log(this);\n    let articles = {\n      'coq10': {\n        component: CoQ10Article,\n        title: \"Congestive Heart Failure\",\n        download: 'something.pdf',\n        author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n        date: 'July 29, 2015',\n      },\n      'eating': {\n        component: EatingArticle,\n        title: \"Eat Well!\",\n        download: 'something.pdf',\n        author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n        date: 'September 2, 2015',\n      },\n      'gi': {\n        component: GIArticle,\n        title: \"GI Health\",\n        download: 'something.pdf',\n        author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n        date: 'July 29, 2015',\n      },\n      'prevention': {\n        component: PreventionArticle,\n        title: \"Prevention\",\n        download: 'something.pdf',\n        author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n        date: 'July 31, 2015',\n      },\n      'sugar': {\n        component: SugarArticle,\n        title: \"Straight Talk on Diabetes and Sugar Consumption\",\n        download: 'something.pdf',\n        author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n        date: 'November 10, 2015',\n      },\n      // 'dietary': {\n      //   component: DietaryArticle,\n      //   title: \"Dietary Guidelines\",\n      //   download: 'something.pdf',\n      //   author: 'Dr. Chris Link',\n      //   date: 'July 29, 2015',\n      // },\n    };\n    let { currentKey } = this.state;\n    let currentArticle = articles[currentKey || 'coq10'];\n    let Component = currentArticle.component;\n    let { classes } = this.props;\n    return (<Layout>\n      <SEO title={currentArticle.title} />\n      <SubLayout title={'Articles'}>\n      <Grid container justify={'center'}>\n        <Grid item xs={8}>\n          <Paper className={classes.paper}>\n          <Typography className={classes.sectionHeader} variant={'h4'}>{currentArticle.title}</Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.author}>{currentArticle.author}</Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.date}>{currentArticle.date}</Typography>\n          <Component />\n          </Paper>\n          {/* <Typography className={classes.para}>Want to download this article?
