              | Cupping was developed thousands of years ago and though the
              | techniques have modernized, the original philosophy remains
              | the same to mobilize Qi, the natural healing energy of the body.
            p
              | Cupping involves placing glass, bamboo or plastic jars on the
              | skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. The
              | underlying tissue is raised, or sucked, partway into the cup.
              | The purpose of cupping is to enhance circulation, help relieve
              | pain, remove "heat" and pull out the toxins that linger in your
              | body's tissues.

              | Usually there is a tight sensation in the area of the cup.
              | Often, this sensation is relaxing and quite pleasant. Depending
              | on your comfort and your practitioner's assessment of the
              | problem, cups may be moved around or left in place. They may
              | remain on your body briefly or for longer amounts of time.
              | Each treatment is unique to you on that particular day. One
              | very common area to be cupped is the back, although cups work
              | well on other areas, too - particularly on fleshy sections of
              | the body.
            p
              | Cupping causes the skin to temporarily turn red, blue or purple,
              | especially if there is an injury or energetic blockage under
              | the area that was cupped. The skin discoloration can last
              | anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, but is rarely
              | painful. Once the marks have cleared, the procedure can be
              | repeated until the condition is resolved.
