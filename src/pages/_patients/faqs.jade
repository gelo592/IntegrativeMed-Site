          h4#q1 What is Acupuncture?
          p
            b Acupuncture
            |  is a method of encouraging the body to promote natural healing
            | and to improve functioning. This is done by inserting needles and
            | applying heat or electrical stimulation at very precise acupuncture points.
          br
          h4#q2 How does acupuncture work?
          p
            | The classical Chinese explanation is that channels of energy run
            | in regular patterns through the body and over its surface. These
            | energy channels, called meridians, are like rivers flowing through
            | the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues. An obstruction in
            | the movement of these energy rivers is like a dam that backs up
            | in one part of the body and restricts it in others.
          p
            | The meridians can be influenced by needling the acupuncture points;
            | the acupuncture needles unblock the obstructions at the dams, and
            | reestablish the regular flow through the meridians. Acupuncture
            | treatments can therefore help the body's internal organs to
            | correct imbalances in their digestion, absorption, and energy
            | production activities, and in the circulation of their energy
            | through the meridians.
          p
            | The modern scientific explanation is that needling the acupuncture
            | points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the
            | muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These chemicals will either change
            | the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other
            | chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system.
          p
            | The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture
            | results in stimulating the body's natural healing abilities,
            | and in promoting physical and emotional well-being.
          br
          h4#q3 What is medical acupuncture? Is it different from ordinary acupuncture?
          p
            | Acupuncture is a very old medical art, and there are many approaches
            | to learning and practicing it. Medical acupuncture is the term used
            | to describe acupuncture performed by a doctor trained and licensed
            | in Western medicine who has also had thorough training in acupuncture
            | as a specialty practice. Such a doctor can use one or the other
            | approach, or a combination of both as the need arises, to treat an illness.
          br
          h4#q4 What is the scope of medical acupuncture?
          p Medical acupuncture is a system which can influence three areas of health care:
          ul
            li promotion of health and well-being,
            li prevention of illness,
            li treatment of various medical conditions.
          br
          p
            | While acupuncture is often associated with pain control, in the
            | hands of a well-trained practitioner it has much broader
            | applications. Acupuncture can be effective as the only treatment
            | used, or as the support or adjunct to other medial treatment
            | forms in many medical and surgical disorders. The World Health
            | Organization recognizes the use of acupuncture in the treatment
            | of a wide range of medical problems, including:
          ul
            li
              | Digestive disorders: gastritis and hyperacidity, spastic
              | colon, constipation, diarrhea.
            li
              | Respiratory disorders: sinusitis, sore throat, bronchitis,
              | asthma, recurrent chest infections.
            li
              | Neurological and muscular disorders: headaches, facial tics,
              | neck pain, rib neuritis, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, various
              | forms of tendinitis, low back pain, sciatica, osteoarthritis.
            li
              | Urinary, menstrual, and reproductive problems.
            li
              | Acupuncture is particularly useful in resolving physical problems
              | related to tension and stress and emotional conditions.
          br
          h4#q5 How many treatments will I need?
          p
            | The number of treatments needed differs from person to person.
            | For complex or long-standing conditions, one or two treatments a week
            | for several months may be recommended. For acute problems, usually
            | fewer visits are required. For health maintenance, four sessions a
            | year may be all that is necessary.
          br
          h4#q6 Are there any side effects to the treatment?
          p
            | Usually not. As energy is redirected in the body, internal
            | chemicals and hormones are stimulated and healing begins to
            |  take place. Occasionally the original symptoms worsen for
            | a few days; or other general changes in appetite, sleep,
            | bowel or urination patterns, or emotional state may be triggered.
            | These should not cause concern, as they are simply indications
            | that the acupuncture is starting to work. It is quite common
            | with the first one or two treatments to have a sensation of
            | deep relaxation or even mild disorientation immediately following
            | the treatment. These pass within a short time, and never require
            | anything more than a bit of rest to overcome.
          br
          h4#q7 What are the needles like? Do they hurt?
          p
            | People experience acupuncture needling differently. Most
            | patients feel only minimal pain as the needles are inserted;
            | some feel no pain at all. Once the needles are in place,
            | there is no pain felt. Acupuncture needles are very thin and
            | solid and are made from stainless steel. The point is smooth
            | (not hollow with cutting edges like a hypodermic needle) and
            | insertion through the skin is not as painful as injections or
            | blood sampling. The risk of bruising and skin irritation is
            | less than when using a hollow needle. Because your doctor uses
            | disposable needles, there is no risk of infection from the treatments.
          br
          h4#q8 Does acupuncture really work?
          p
            | Yes. In the past 2,000 years, more people have been successfully
            | treated with acupuncture than with all other health modalities
            | combined. Today acupuncture is practiced widely in Asia, the
            | Soviet Union, and in Europe. It is now being used more and more
            | in America by patients and physicians. Acupuncture treatments
            | can be given at the same time other techniques are being used,
            | such as conventional Western medicine, osteopathic or chiropractic
            | adjustments, and homeopathic or naturopathic prescriptions.
            | It is important that your physician-acupuncturist know everything
            | that you are doing, so he or she can help you get the
            | most benefit from all your treatments.
          br
          h4#q9 Do I have to believe in acupuncture for it to work?
          p
            | No. Acupuncture is used successfully on cats, dogs, horses
            | and other animals. These animal patients do not understand
            | or believe in the process that helps them get better. A
            | positive attitude toward wellness may reinforce the effects
            | of the treatment received, just as a negative attitude may
            | hinder the effects of acupuncture or any other treatment.
            | A neutral attitude ("I don't know if I really believe in this.")
            | will not block the treatment results.
          br
          h4#q10 Are there any "DOs and DON'Ts" for me on the day of a treatment?
          ul
            li
              | Do not eat an unusually large meal immediately before or after
              | your treatment and drink plenty of fluids.
            li
              | Do not over-exercise, engage in sexual activity, or consume
              | alcoholic beverages within 6 hours before or after the treatment.
            li
              | Plan your activities so that after the treatment you can get
              | some rest, or at least not have to be working at top performance.
              | This is especially important for the first few visits.
            li
              | Continue to take any prescription medicines as directed by
              | your regular doctor. Substance abuse (drugs and alcohol)
              | especially in the week prior to treatment will seriously
              | interfere with the effectiveness of acupuncture treatments.
            li
              | Remember to keep good mental or written notes of what your
              | response is to the treatment. This is important for your doctor
              | to know so that he can modify your follow-up treatments.
          br
          h4#q11 Is acupunture covered by health insurance?
          p
            | Some insurance companies currently cover acupuncture costs;
            | other companies do not yet recognize the value of acupuncture.
            | Each health policy must be reviewed to determine acupuncture benefits.
            | More and more insurance companies are recognizing the value of providing
            | coverage for medical acupuncture services. You can help by insisting
            | that your insurance company offer you reimbursement for acupuncture.
